# Rubik's Cube Solver

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python-based solver for Rubik's Cube. The primary goal is to provide a software solution for solving a Rubik's Cube using various algorithms and techniques.

## Features
- **Automated Solver**: Uses algorithmic approaches to solve a given state of the Rubik's Cube.
- **State Representation**: Efficient representation of the cube's state for processing.
- **User Interface**: (Optional) A simple interface for users to input their cube's state and get the solution steps.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranshul-kaushik/Rubiks-Cube.git
cd Rubiks-Cube
```
2. Run the solver:
```bash
python solver.py
```
3. Follow the instructions on the interface to input the cube's state and get the solution.
